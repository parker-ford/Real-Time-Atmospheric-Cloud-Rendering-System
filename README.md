# Real-Time Atmospheric Cloud Rendering System

This repository contains the accompanying code for the paper **"Real-Time Atmospheric Cloud Rendering System"**, published in the *2024 37th SIBGRAPI Conference on Graphics, Patterns and Images (SIBGRAPI)*.

The paper introduces a real-time cloud rendering system that integrates:
- An effective cloud modeling solution.
- An efficient volumetric rendering framework.
- Recent findings in inter-droplet scattering.
- A novel Temporal Anti-Aliasing solution.

This system serves as a foundation for further research and experimentation in realistic cloud rendering.
